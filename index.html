    <div class="context">

        Passionate, energetic software developer looking to grow into a role where I can use my
        teaching skills to train and mentor new developers. I'm highly motivated to learn in order
        to achieve this goal. I enjoy using my creativity to solve both complex and simple problems.
        Some of my most valuable learning moments as a developer have been as a result of spending 
        time in debug mode to learn the flow of a software solution, and to better understand how problems can be solved.
